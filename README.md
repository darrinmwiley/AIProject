Requirements:
1) python3 (not python2)
2) python sklearn library (pip3 install sklearn)
3) graphviz (pip3 install graphviz, then brew install graphviz)

To Run:
There are two files, each named master.py, one in each folder of the project (League of Legends vs Call of Duty). Navigate to the location of either of these files, and then run "pyton3 master.py" to see the results of that run.
